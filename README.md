# DevUG Talk on Go and Fyne desktop development

## Technologies used

- Go [https://go.dev/](https://go.dev/)
- Fyne [https://fyne.io/](https://fyne.io/)

Basically, I'm building a simple desktop application using Go, traditionally more seen as a backend development 
language and the Fyne UI toolkit.

## Project aim

To demonstrate the ability of Go to be used in flexible ways to development different styles of solutions. In this 
instance, a desktop application.
