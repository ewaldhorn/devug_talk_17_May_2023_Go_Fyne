# DevUG Talk on Go and Fyne desktop development

## Technologies used

- Go [https://go.dev/](https://go.dev/)
- Fyne [https://fyne.io/](https://fyne.io/)

Basically, I'm building a simple desktop application using Go, traditionally more seen as a backend development 
language and the Fyne UI toolkit.

## Project aim

To demonstrate the ability of Go to be used in flexible ways to development different styles of solutions. In this 
instance, a desktop application.

## Learning Go

FreeCodeCamp have released an awesome tutorial [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/go-golang-course/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/go-golang-course/)
that teaches you Go from the ground up! I highly recommend putting some time aside and working through this if you are interested
in the language.
